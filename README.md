# Java_Knowledge

In this project, I collect and categorize the knowledge I obtain during my studies of Java.
The goal is to have a perfect explanation at hand, in case I forgot something. 
Currently, the base contains topics such as:
* Classes, objects, constructors, method overloading, ...
* Primitive types, Strings, Arrays
* Casting of different data types
* Special classes from class libraries ( Math, Scanner )
* Operators
